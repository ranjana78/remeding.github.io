My main idea lies in making an online platform called 'Re-MedEng' where Engineering and
Medical Students can sell their used equipments, apparatus, books etc related to academics
which can be useful to other students who wish to buy it at a discounted rate. The full form
of 'Re-MedEng' means Reselling Medical and Engineering Materials. My primary goal is to
join the two ends of the students system where one end wants to sell his/her
engineering/medical items and other end wants to buy these items at a low price through a
global and unique platform.
